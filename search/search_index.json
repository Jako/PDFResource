In the MODX Manager, navigate to the Package Manager page, and select 'Search locally for packages' from the dropdown button. PDFResource should now show up in the list of available packages. Click the corresponding 'Install' button and follow the instructions to complete the installation. Build it from source To build and install the package from source you could use Git Package Management . The GitHub repository of PDFResource contains a config.json to build that package locally. Use this option, if you want to debug PDFResource and/or contribute bugfixes and enhancements.

The generated PDF files are saved with the current alias path to {assets_url}/pdf/ So after the installation you only have to assign the template variable create_pdf to the templates of the resources that should be converted to PDF and check that template variable in the resource (checked by default). PDF generation on the fly To generate PDF files on the fly with PDFResource you have to assign the template variable live_pdf to a template (the template variable name could be changed in MODX system settings) and check this template variable on a resource. After this, the resource will be rendered as PDF file in the browser. The file could be saved with the current alias. Caution This option should only be activated, if the content of the resource is dynamically changed. Generating the PDF is a quite resource consuming process and it could take some time. PDF options By default the PDF content and the CSS code for the PDF could be changed with the chunks tplPDF and tplCSS . Some other PDF options (pagesize, margins etc.) could be set in MODX system setting. The following MODX system settings are available in the namespace pdfresource : Key Description Default pdfresource.mode mPDF mode, see mode parameter and choosing a configuration in the mPDF documentation for possible values. - pdfresource.format PDF page size. If you want to change the orientation of a \"named\" PDF page size you have to append -L to the PDF page size string (i.e. A4-L).

If you want to change the orientation of a \"named\" PDF page size you have to append -L to the PDF page size string (i.e. A4-L). P pdfresource.pdfTpl Template chunk for the PDF content. You could use @FILE binding to retreive the chunk from a file. tplPDF pdfresource.cssTpl Template chunk for the PDF style. You could use @FILE binding to retreive the chunk from a file. tplCSS pdfresource.pdfTv Name ot the template variable that activates the PDF generation. create_pdf pdfresource.pdfTvLive Name of the template variable that activates the on the fly PDF generation. live_pdf pdfresource.pdfTvOptions Name of the template variable that change the options of the generated PDF. The content of this template variable has to contain a JSON encoded object of the options you want to change. pdf_options pdfresource.processTVs Process template variables during PDF generation. Yes pdfresource.tvPrefix Template variable prefix in the template chunk. .tv pdfresource.customFonts JSON encoded object of custom fonts, see Custom fonts for an example. Please copy the font files to {core_path}components/pdfresource/vendor/mpdf/mpdf/ttfonts/ . - pdfresource.generateOnPrerender Generate not existing PDF files during OnWebPagePrerender. This option is useful, if you have installed PDFResource in an existing MODX installation.

This template variable has to contain an JSON encoded object of options without the prefix pdfresource. . Example { \"format\": \"A4-L\", \"mgl\": 20, \"mgr\": 20 } PDF content template The content of the PDF is filled with the chunk defined by pdfresource.pdfTpl MODX system setting (or on resource base by the pdf_options template variable). By default PDFResource uses the tplPDF chunk. You could fill this chunk like a normal MODX template with resource placeholders, snippet calls etc. Since the PDF is not created on the fly, the content is fixed after saving the resource. PDF styles template The style of the PDF is set with the chunk defined by pdfresource.cssTpl MODX system setting (or on resource base by the pdf_options template variable). By default PDFResource uses the tplCSS chunk. There are some limitations with mPDF and CSS (i.e. position: absolute works only with elements on root level). Custom fonts To use custom fonts in your PDF files, you have to add them as JSON encoded object in the MODX system setting pdfresource.customFonts . See Fonts in the mPDF documentation a the full description. Example { \"frutiger\": { \"R\": \"Frutiger-Normal.ttf\", \"I\": \"FrutigerObl-Normal.ttf\" } } Please copy the font files to {core_path}components/pdfresource/vendor/mpdf/mpdf/ttfonts/ . PDF permissions The generated PDF could be encrypted to set user permissions. An user password to open the file and an owner password to bypass and/or change the permission restrictions could be set. The PDF encryption is enabled if the user or the owner password is set. A list of permissions could be found at permissions in the mPDF documentation. By default all permissions are denied if the file is encrypted. The following example JSON will grant copying and printing (low-res) to the end-user of the generated PDF. Example [\"copy\", \"print\"] Other mPDF options If you want to set other mPDF options to modify the PDF file creation, you could call the mPDF class methods with callbacks. To use the callbacs, you first have to fill the MODX system setting pdfresource.mPDFMethods with an JSON encoded array of called method names. After that, you have to fill the according MODX system setting or (on resource base) an according key in pdf_options template variable. The method parameters have to be set by an JSON encoded array. Example To call the mPDF method SetHTMLFooter you have to set the MODX system setting pdfresource.mPDFMethods to [\"SetHTMLFooter\"] After that you have to create a MODX system setting pdfresource.SetHTMLFooter and fill it with [\"<div align='right' style='font-size: 8pt;'>{PAGENO}</div><div align='center' style='font-size: 8pt; font-style: italic;'><hr>My footer text.</div>\"] or fill the PDF Options template variable of a resource with { \"SetHTMLFooter\": [ \"<div align='right' style='font-size: 8pt;'>{PAGENO}</div><div align='center' style='font-size: 8pt; font-style: italic;'><hr>My footer text.</div>\" ] } Linking to a generated PDF All generated static PDF files are saved with the aliaspath of the generating resource.
